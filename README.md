# Customer-Churn-Analysis-for-Telecom-Industry

In the competitive telecom industry, customer retention is crucial for maintaining profitability. Customer churn — the loss of clients to competitors — can significantly affect a company's bottom line. This project develops a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving, based on usage patterns, behaviors, and other influential factors. Early identification enables businesses to implement targeted strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

This repository provides a comprehensive solution, including the dataset, predictive modeling code, and insights into the primary drivers of customer attrition. It also offers actionable recommendations to help telecom companies strengthen customer retention efforts.

# Objective

1. Dataset Overview:
A detailed examination of the dataset, covering key attributes such as customerID, gender, senior citizen status, partnership and dependent status, tenure, phone service usage, and more.

2. Customer Profile Analysis:
An exploration of customer demographics, service usage patterns, contract types, billing preferences, and payment methods.

3. Internet and Service Features:
Insights into internet service availability and associated features, including online security, backup services, device protection, technical support, and streaming services.

4. Contract and Billing Information:
An analysis of customer contract terms, paperless billing adoption, preferred payment methods, and financial metrics such as monthly and total charges.

5. Churn Analysis and Modeling Workflow:
A structured approach that includes dataset exploration, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, predictive modeling, and summary conclusions.

6. Visual Insights with Power BI:
Interactive dashboards and visualizations built using Power BI provide strategic insights into churn behavior, customer segmentation, demographic patterns, and service usage. These visual tools enhance understanding of churn drivers and support data-driven decision-making.

# Methodology

1. Data Collection and Preparation:

Curated a comprehensive dataset comprising customer demographics, service usage details, contract specifics, and billing preferences.
Employed rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure data integrity and consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted in-depth EDA to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and anomalies within the dataset.
Visualized key metrics such as customer segmentation by contract type and churn propensity across different customer segments using tools like Power BI for interactive visualizations.

3. Predictive Modeling:

Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluated model performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score to select the optimal model for churn prediction.

4. Power BI for Visual Insights:
   
Implemented Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that provide intuitive insights into churn patterns.
Visualized model predictions, feature importance, and customer segmentation to facilitate strategic decision-making and operational planning.

# Key Insights

* Strategic Insights-
   
  Customer Segmentation: Identify high-risk customer segments prone to churn.
  
  Service Optimization: Evaluate the impact of service features and contract terms on customer retention.
  
  Financial Impact: Quantify revenue loss due to churn and explore strategies for revenue recovery.
