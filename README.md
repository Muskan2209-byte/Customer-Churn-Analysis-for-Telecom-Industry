This project develops a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving, based on usage patterns, behaviors, and other influential factors. Early identification enables businesses to implement targeted strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

This repository provides a comprehensive solution, including the dataset, predictive modeling code, and insights into the primary drivers of customer attrition. It also offers actionable recommendations to help telecom companies strengthen customer retention efforts.
